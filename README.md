# A sample AWS Lambda with OpenCV
## About
Based on [this twilio signal project](https://github.com/ranman/aws-lambda-twilio-signal/blob/master/index.js) and the [guidelines by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/nodejs-packages-in-lambda/) 

## Instalation
Refer to [wiki](https://github.com/nolim1t/opencv-aws-lambda/wiki). This package is as it is and can be zipped up and pushed directly to AWS Lambda by the console or CLI. (Wiki has the CLI commands).  For zipping up this package you can probably download it from github directly (untested)

## Notes
* This is completely experimental. There is probably nothing here yet
